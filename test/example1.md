# Hello World

Here comes the \bold{fett and \italic{kursiv}} \italic{text}.

This text is \style(fontWeight=FontWeight.Bold){bold}.

Now something in \red{RED}, with \underline{underline} and with \strike{strike out}.
Futhermore, we can write \tt{typewriter}.

\p\bold A new paragraph with a command in front.
\h1\color(0, 0, 255) All blue
\h1\red All red

The text \red from here on is red, because of `\red`.

\h2\margin(20, 20, 20, 20) With extra margin
\h2\margin(left=20*mm, right=20*mm) Left right margin
\h2\center More in the center

As we have shown in \ref("intro"), ours is the best.
